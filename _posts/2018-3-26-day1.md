so far im liking debian.

the interface feels homemade. it feels cosy. its like the difference between AAA games and indie games. kindof.

it is different. the good kind of different. 

also, my pc  boots and turns off wat faster than it used to. it feels easier to access.

problems i have so far:

..* wifi doesnt work. i need to fix it somehow.

..* xfce panel sometimes doesnt start. i suspect that i might be turning it off without realizing.

..* i need to somehow install something called firmware-amd-graphics.

those to a side, the machine feels alien. some old shortcut keys seem to do nothing.

the thing i will miss most will definitely be ctrl+alt+delete

first couple of hours all my time was spent on firefox. i should change the way i look at computers.

note beyond time: writing in nano was painful. i need to get myself a text editor and/or read some manuals.
i have a feeling that there will be a lot of manual reading in the coming days.
